          One delicious Mediterranean dish that includes chickpeas, avocado,
          pita bread, and olive oil is a Mediterranean chickpea salad. This
          refreshing and flavorful salad typically features a bed of mixed
          greens topped with chickpeas, diced avocado, sliced cherry tomatoes,
          and diced cucumber, all dressed with a simple lemon and olive oil
          dressing. The salad is usually served with warm pita bread on the side
          for dipping and scooping. The combination of creamy avocado, hearty
          chickpeas, and tangy dressing makes for a tasty and satisfying meal
          that's both healthy and delicious.

          One mouth-watering Mediterranean dish that incorporates coriander,
          avocado, tomato, lemon, and jalapeno is a spicy avocado and tomato
          salsa. This zesty salsa typically features diced ripe tomatoes and
          creamy avocado mixed with fresh coriander, spicy jalapeno peppers, and
          a squeeze of tangy lemon juice. The result is a deliciously bold and
          refreshing mix of flavors that's perfect for dipping with pita bread,
          tortilla chips, or even as a topping for grilled fish or chicken. The
          combination of creamy avocado, juicy tomatoes, and zesty spices makes
          for a satisfying and healthy snack or appetizer that's sure to please
          any palate.

          A flavorful Mediterranean dish that includes salmon is grilled salmon
          with a citrus and herb marinade. The salmon is typically marinated in
          a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and a blend of
          Mediterranean herbs such as oregano and thyme. The marinated salmon is
          then grilled until it's perfectly cooked and flaky, with a slightly
          charred and crispy exterior. The dish is usually served with a side of
          roasted vegetables, such as zucchini or eggplant, and a refreshing
          salad of mixed greens dressed with a tangy vinaigrette. This dish is
          not only delicious, but also a great source of healthy omega-3 fatty
          acids and other essential nutrients that are important for a
          well-balanced diet.
